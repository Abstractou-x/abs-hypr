Hi! 

This is my first ever configuration for hyprland.

Its not as great as some other configs that i've seen so i'm not saying that you should use it

its mostly for me, because i like saving my configs. I don't even know why i made it public lol



It has only the most basic of basic configurations. That means no theme switcher, no custom rofi menus, no extremely cool nvim configs. Just waybar, hyprpaper and such

Everything else is in the making

Here's a screenshot:
